I consider the process of pursuing my PhD as a journey to learn not only about science, but also about life. Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Roderich Gross for their support in this journey. This journey could not be perfect without his supervision. He helped me from toddling to walking on the pathway in this research field by motivating, teaching and passing their experience to me without any reservation. 

Second, many people have contributed to this journey, especially people in the Natural Robotic Lab: Melvin Gauci, Jianing Chen, Yuri, Stefan, who makes the lab a warm, supportive and fun environment. Special thanks to Melvin Gauci and Jianing Chen. To Melvin, I considered myself very lucky that I met him from the start of this unforgettable journey. I have learned much from him on doing research and life. We not only had many collaborations on research, but we also shared the experience outside science. To Jianing Chen, I appreciated his help. 

Outside the research group, there are also a number of people who helped me during my stay in Sheffield, especially Xiao Chen, Yuzhu Guo. This journey would not be completed without their encouragement. 
   
To my parents, thank you for giving me a free environment to grow up and always supporting me.
  
To my wife, Yifei.
