I consider the process of pursuing my PhD as a journey to learn not only about science, but also about life. Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr. Roderich Gro\ss 
~and Prof. Stephen A. Billings for their support in this journey. The special thanks would be given to Roderich. He helped me from toddling to walking on the pathway in this research field by motivating, teaching and passing his professional experience to me without any reservation. He is always very patient to discuss with me and give me professional suggestions. His passion for pursuing science and rigorous attitude in research have significantly influenced me. 

Second, many people have contributed to this journey, especially people in the Natural Robotics Lab: Melvin Gauci, Jianing Chen, Yuri K. Lopes, Christopher Parrott, Fernando Perez Diaz, Stefan Trenkwalder, Gabriel Kapellmann Zafra, Matthew Doyle, and Shen-Chiang Chen, who make the lab a warm, supportive and fun environment. Special thanks to Melvin Gauci and Jianing Chen. To Melvin, I considered myself very lucky that I met him from the start of this unforgettable journey. I have learned much from him on doing research and life. We not only had many collaborations on research, but we also shared the experience outside science. To Jianing, I appreciate his help for sharing his knowledge with me and providing valuable feedback when I did my experiments. 

Outside the research group, there are also a number of people who helped me during my stay in Sheffield, especially Xiao Chen and Yuzhu Guo. This journey would not be completed without their encouragement. 
   
Finally, I would like to thank my family. To my parents, thank you for giving me a free environment to grow up and always supporting me without any hesitation. To my wife, Yifei, thank you for always accompanying and encouraging me, which makes me maintain a positive attitude for life.
