I consider the process of pursuing my PhD as a journey to learn not only about science, but also about life. Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr. Roderich Gro\ss 
~and Prof. Stephen A. Billings for their support in this journey. This journey can not be finished without their supervision. The special thanks would be given to Dr. Roderich Gro\ss. He helped me from toddling to walking on the pathway in this research field by motivating, teaching and passing his professional experience to me without any reservation. His passion for pursuing science and positive attitude have deeply influenced and encouraged me in my future life.  

Second, many people have contributed to this journey, especially people in the Natural Robotics Lab: Melvin Gauci, Jianing Chen, Yuri K. Lopes, Stefan Trenkwalder, Fernando Perez Diaz, Christopher Parrott, Matthew Doyle, Gabriel Kapellmann Zafra and Shen-Chiang Chen, who make the lab a warm, supportive and fun environment. Special thanks to Melvin Gauci and Jianing Chen. To Melvin, I considered myself very lucky that I met him from the start of this unforgettable journey. I have learned much from him on doing research and life. We not only had many collaborations on research, but we also shared the experience outside science. To Jianing, I appreciate his help for sharing his knowledge with me and providing valuable feedback when I did my experiments. 

Outside the research group, there are also a number of people who helped me during my stay in Sheffield, especially Xiao Chen and Yuzhu Guo. This journey would not be completed without their encouragement. 
   
To my parents, thank you for giving me a free environment to grow up and always supporting me without any hesitation. 
  
To my wife, Yifei, thank you for accompanying me and encouraging me to maintain a positive attitude during this journal. It is you that make my life more colorful and meaningful.
